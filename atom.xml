    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>When do Cubs meet?</h3>

<p>We meet on a Thursday evening from 7:00 to 8:30 pm.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.mikeweb.plus.com/Sections/Cubs/Cubs_files/image001.jpg" alt="Cubs image" /></p>

<h3>How old do I have to be to become a Cub ?</h3>

<p>You need to be between 8 and 10 years old to become a cub.</p>

<h3>What will I do each week?</h3>

<p>Each term the leaders ask the cubs which badges they would like to do and build a programme around that. <!-- more --> At the pack meetings we start with Grand Howl then play a mixture of games and do badge work. We also go out and play wide games, go hiking or orienteering or other outdoor activities. Sometimes there are weekend activities, such as district football or chess competitions or cub camps.</p>

<h3>How is Cubs organised?</h3>

<p>The Cub Scout Leader is called Akele and the Assistant Cub Scout Leader is Bagheera. We are helped by a young leader and parent helpers.</p>

<p>The pack is split into sixes and each six is led by a <em>Sixer</em> (an older cub). Our sixes are Blue, Red, Green and Yellow and when you come to cubs you will be put in one of the Sixes.</p>

<h3>Are there any rules?</h3>

<p>We know you don’t want to feel like you are at school and we want you to have lots of fun but, to ensure that everyone has fun, we ask you to follow a code of conduct:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cubs stand quietly and alert at Grand Howl.</li>
<li>Respect the leaders and helpers and when they are speaking cubs should be quiet and listening</li>
<li>There is no fighting or bad language. If there is a dispute talk to a leader and we will sort it out.</li>
<li>Respect the Den and the furniture and equipment.</li>
<li>Respect your fellow cubs and their belongings</li>
</ul>


<h3>What uniform will I have to wear?</h3>

<p>Full uniform is a green Cub sweatshirt and blue Scout activity trousers. You will be given a yellow and brown scarf when you get invested.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Baughurst was representing Silchester at the annual event held in Southampton, which is open to all Scout Districts in Hampshire, after having won the District competition where they had played against teams from Headley, Bramley and Tadley. This is the first time that Baughurst Cub Scouts have represented Silchester at this event.</p>

<p>On the day 18 teams took part in the Competition, which is now in its 28th year, and consists of 2 trophies; the Main Cup, which is played on a league basis with the top team in each league going through to the Final stages, and the Plate Trophy, a knock out competition for teams who did not win their league.</p>

<p>The event itself is probably best summed up by two emails received.
The first from Graham Brooks  &#8220;What a Day! On Sunday Baughurst Cub Scouts won Hampshire Counties Scout Council&#8217;s Plate trophy for six-a-side football. They never gave up drawing for most of the games  but towards the end starting winning games. They won 5 - 0 in the semi finals against Southampton City and in the final won 1-0 against Petersfield,  Petersfield was Baughurst Cub Scout&#8217;s hardest game, towards the end even Petersfield&#8217;s goal keeper came forward to try to score a goal. What impressed me the most was the cubs team work, decision making and changing tactics. It was great seeing a small rural group winning against much larger districts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second email from one of the parents “the day was priceless, what a great bunch of kids they are,  a real credit to you (Cub Scout Leaders)”</p>

<p>The cubs were still on a high when we met for the last pack meeting of the term. Of the cubs that played at both competitions 7 are due to move up to Scouts over the course of this year so this has been a fantastic end to their time at cubs.</p>
