			Hi my name is Piglet and I am the Guider for 2nd Baughurst Brownies. We meet every Tuesday evening from 5.15 to 6.45 (term time) at the Baughurst Scout and Guide Den.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a very supportive team who are also named after the chanters of Winnie the Pooh. There is Owl who is Assistant Guider, Kanga, Winie the Pooh, Eeyore, and Rabbit who are Unit Helpers and Tigger and Roo who are Young Leaders. We are all volunteers who gain as much from ‘working’ with the Brownies as hopefully they get from coming to Brownies.

			There are usually 30 Brownies on role who enjoy a varied termly programme which they plan (with abit of support) themselves. They do this by holding a special get-together called a ‘Pow Wow’. All of the Brownies and Leaders sit together in a circle and decide what they want to do. Everyone is equal and everyone can have a say if they would like to.
		</p>
		<p>
			Brownies also enjoy working on interest badges. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When a girl joins Brownies she is put into a Six. They are Foxes, Hedgehogs, Moles and Rabbits.
		</p>
		<p>
			Brownies usually make a Promise when they have been at Brownies for a while. We normally play a few games and think about what a promise is.
