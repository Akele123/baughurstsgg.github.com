Guides is our section for girls aged 10 to 14.

Members take part in a wide range of exciting activities at their regular meetings, and at special events or holidays. Girls do everything from adventure sports to playing fun games, and from taking part in community action projects to the performing arts.

Guides work together in small groups or 'Patrols' and, with the support of an adult Leader, choose and run some of the activities themselves using [Go for It!](http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/guides/gfibadge/gfi/index.html) resource packs.

The Guide programme is divided into five areas:

*   discovery of new experiences and challenges
*   healthy lifestyles
*   global awareness
*   skills and relationships
*   celebrating diversity.

Girls can extend their knowledge and skills by working towards [Guide interest badges](http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/guides/gfibadge/badges/index.html) covering many different hobbies and activities from Film lover to Independent living. They can also gain Challenge badges that recognise their participation in guiding over a period of time. The badges build towards the [Baden-Powell Challenge Award](http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/guides/gfibadge/badges/badenpowellchallengeaward.html), named in honour of the [founder of guiding](http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/about_us/key_information/history.aspx).
