## Who are we?

Beaver Scouts are the youngest section of scouting, and we are aged between 6 and 8.  Boys *and* girls can become beaver scouts!



<blockquote>
  <p>Friends and Fun!</p>

</blockquote>

Beaver Scouts like to have __fun__, make friends, play games and get badges!  We have meetings at the den, and we also go on trips and have sleepovers.

## How do I join in?

We meet on Wednesday evenings between 6:15 and 7:15 pm.  
Beaver Scouts wear a turquoise sweatshirt and a yellow and brown scarf when they have been invested.  


4 to 6 weeks after coming to beaver scouts, you are invested. This is a special ceremony and your parents are invited.  If your parents like, they can take photographs to show your friends and relations. 

Durung the ceremony you will:

*   Make the Beaver Scout promise
*   Be given a certificate
*   Get yout group scarf
*   Get the first badges for your uniform
