		<p>Hi, we are 2nd Burnham Copse Rainbows and would like to tell you a little bit about ourselves.</p>
		<p>We meet up on Mondays 5.45-7pm (term times) at Baughurst Scout and Guide Den.</p>
		<p>We have 2 Guiders, Piglet and Linnet and 2 Unit Helpers Mole and Badger and a Young Leader called Tigger.</p>
		<p>
			There are 16 Rainbows altogether and we wear red tabards or the Rainbow track suit. We start off our sessions every week by singing a couple of songs, we then usually make something to take home. We nearly always play a game or two and then we sing our goodbye songs just before itâ€™s time to go.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we have attended Rainbows for a few weeks we have a special book to work on. When it is finished we are enrolled. Our friends and family are invited to Rainbows to watch us make our Rainbow Promise.
