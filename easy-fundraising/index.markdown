			Support us for FREE when you do your shopping on the web! Yes, that’s right...this is absolutely FREE to you but raises much needed funds for the group.
		</p>
		
		<h3>But what is it?</h3>
		<p>
			Easyfundraising is simply a webpage from which you can access over 200 stores, including Tesco, LastMinute.com, HMV, Vodafone, Amazon, John Lewis, M&S to name but a few.
		</p>

		<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
		<p>
			Simply visit <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/baughurstsgg/">our webpage</a> and register your details. Then, whenever you want to go shopping, log on to Easyfundraising and shop as normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, and remember to check out the competitions and “Special Deals” before shopping – Akele ordered an item for £39 but, because she used a special deal code, she saved £11!
		</p>

		<h4>What am I committed to?</h4>
		<p>
			There is no commitment – you choose when, and if, you use it but remember, every time you log in you are raising additional funds to help us maintain our den and deliver exciting programmes to your child.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do your weekly shop, book your holiday or just order those one off birthday presents ….. with a couple of extra clicks, you could be raising extra funds for us at no extra cost to yourself.

		<p>You can also raise funds for us every time you search the Web!</p>
		<p>
			Use easysearch every time you search the Web and 50% of the fees paid by the advertising sponsors will be given to Baughurst Scout and Guide Group. Make just 10 searches a day with easysearch instead of Google or any other search engine and you could raise around £20 a year - or more - for us. It's that easy!
