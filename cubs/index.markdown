		<h3>When do Cubs meet?</h3>
		<p>We meet every Thursday evening from 7:00 to 8:30 pm.</p>

		<h3>What will I do each week?</h3>
		<p>Each term the leaders ask the cubs which badges they would like to do and build a programme around that. At the pack meetings we start with Grand Howl then play a mixture of games and do badge work. We also go out and play wide games, go hiking or orienteering or other outdoor activities. Sometimes there are weekend activities, such as district football or chess competitions or cub camps.

		<h3>How is Cubs organised?</h3>

		<p>
			The Cub Scout Leader is called Akele and the Assistant Cub Scout Leader is Bagheera. We are helped by a young leader and parent helpers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The pack is split into sixes and each six is led by a *Sixer* (an older cub). Our sixes are Blue, Red, Green and Yellow and when you come to cubs you will be put in one of the Sixes.
		</p>

		<h3>How old do I have to be to become a Cub ?</h3>
		<p>You need to be between 8 and 10 years old to become a cub. Girls and boys can become cub scouts.</p>

		<h3>Are there any rules?</h3>
		<p>
			We know you don’t want to feel like you are at school and we want you to have lots of fun but, to ensure that everyone has fun, we ask you to follow a code of conduct:
			<ul>
				<li>Cubs stand quietly and alert at Grand Howl.</li>
				<li>Respect the leaders and helpers and when they are speaking cubs should be quiet and listening</li>
				<li>There is no fighting or bad language. If there is a dispute talk to a leader and we will sort it out.</li>
				<li>Respect the Den and the furniture and equipment.</li>
				<li>Respect your fellow cubs and their belongings</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>What uniform will I have to wear?</h3>
		<p>
			Full uniform is a green Cub sweatshirt and blue Scout activity trousers. You will be given a yellow and brown scarf when you get invested.  You can purchase your uniform from the <a href="www.geocities.com/basingstoke4thscouts/info/BasingstokeScoutShop.htm">Basingstoke scout shop</a> or directly from <a href="http://shop.scouts.org.uk">Scout Shops</a>
		</p>

		<h3>What badges are there?</h3>
		<p>
			There are two main types of badges; Challenge and Activity. You can see the badges and what you have to do to get them at http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/badges/cub-index.htm. Some you can work to at home and others with the pack.
		</p>

		<h3>Where do the badges go?</h3>
		<p>
			You will earn lots of badges at Cubs and they each have a special place to go on your uniform. If you go to http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/6to25/cub/badges/uniform.htm  you can see where they need to go.
		</p>

		<h3>When will I be invested?</h3>
		<p>
			Investiture happens between 4 and 6 weeks after you join to give you a chance to settle in. Uniform is required for the investiture but need not be worn until then.
		</p>

		<h3>What happens at the Investiture?</h3>
		<p>
			The Investiture is when each new member formally makes their Promise. Your parents will be invited to the ceremony, which normally takes place at the end of the pack meeting. You will be given a certificate, group scarf, some badges for your uniform and a cub scout powerpack, where you can read about and record all the badges you get. Your parents can take photographs to show your friends and relations.
		</p>

		<h3>Do I have to go to any special ceremonies?</h3>
		<p>
			There are two ceremonies each year that we ask you to attend in full uniform. In April we have the St George’s Day Parade. St George is the patron saint of Scouting and each year we get together with other scout groups in the district and attend a service and parade. This is also the time when we renew our cub scout promise. In November we attend the Remembrance Day service held at the Baughurst Memorial and lay a wreathto those who died fighting in the wars.
		</p>

		<h3>What does it cost to be a Cub?</h3>
		<p>
			Group Subscriptions are set each year and are payable at the 1st April. A letter will be sent to your parents to tell them the exact amount. Cheques should be made payable to "Baughurst Scout and Guide Group". If you start during the year your parents will be asked to pay a proportion of the annual subscription. We will also ask that your parents complete a Gift Aid form so that we can raise further funds for our group.
		</p>

		<h3>How can my parents help?</h3>
		<p>
			Your parents can help in lots of ways. We have a parent rota, which they will be asked to join (we will require all parents to complete CRB forms). They can support us by helping at our fundraising activities (Summer Fayre, Fireworks Night, bag packing etc). If they really enjoy scouting they can become a warranted leader.
