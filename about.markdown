# Who we are



The Baughurst Scout and Guide group provides a very active and exciting program for girls and boys in the local area.

* The rainbow, brownie and guide groups welcome girls from 5 to 14 years.
* The beaver, cub and scout groups welcome both boys and girls from 6 to 14 years.

The Baughurst scout group is part of the [Silchester District](http://www.silchester-scouts.org.uk), which is in turn part of the [Hampshire County](http://www.scouts-hants.org.uk).

The [Baughurst den](Contact.html) provides a headquarters for the active groups.

# We Volunteer - can you?

Baughurst Scout and Guide Group is a registered charity, where the leaders give their time freely and without pay.

A successful group survives with the active support from parents.

There are many ways that you can support the group:

* Get CRB clearance and join our parent rotas!
* Help us with transport to our events and activities
* Suport our fund raising events
* Come to the Group's AGM and social events
* Volunteer to assist on the Group's committee
* Complete a form for ‘Gift Aid’ so we can claim back tax

A great deal of work carries on behind the scenes and we can always use more help. If you have some time to spare and/or have a particular skill, please contact any leader. _All_ offers of help are always gratefully received.

If you really enjoy it, why not consider becoming a warranted leader?
